		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    Microwave 2 cups of rice plus 2 cups of water for 8 minutes, according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the bowl to the fridge to cool rice. Cook the cauliflower rice according to the package, strain any excess liquid and and it to the bowl of the jasmine rice and combine.
                </li>
				<li>
                    In a large pan or wok, heat 1 Tbsp. sesame oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and saute for a couple minutes until fragrant. Add the ham and red pepper to sear and soften the peppers. You want a nice browning on the ham chunks, this will take approximately 5 minutes. 
                </li>
				<li>
                    Add the thawed peas to the pan and stir to combine. Push everything to the outer edges of the pan and add the remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, crack 2 eggs in the center. Stir to scramble and cook until fully cooked through. Mix into the ham mixture to combine. 
                </li>
				<li>
                    Add the chilled cooked rice and cauliflower blend, breaking apart any large clumps, stirring together to combine everything evenly. Let it fry on the bottom for a minute at a time before stirring everything together. Pour the coconut aminos over the rice, and season with pepper. Mix everything well.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Stir in the pineapple chunks and cook for another 2 minutes.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Once everything is well combined and the rice is hot, serve and garnish with chopped green onions if desired. 
                </li>
