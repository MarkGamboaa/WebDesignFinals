                <li>1 Air Fryer</li>
            </ul>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
                <li>1.5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breast or precut cutlets</li>
                <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese grated</li>
                <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp. onion powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 tsp. dried basil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 large eggs beaten</li>
                <li>olive oil spray</li>
                <li>fresh parsley (optional) chopped, for garnish</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    Preheat your air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
                </li>
				<li>
                    In a shallow bowl, mix breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, dried basil, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. This will be your coating mixture.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Butterfly each chicken breast and cut in half to create thinner cutlets. You can also use a meat mallet to gently pound them to an even thickness.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Press each side of the chicken cutlet into the breadcrumb mixture, making sure the coating adheres well.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Place the breaded chicken cutlets in a single layer in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not touching. You may need to cook in batches if there is not enough room.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Lightly spray the top of the chicken cutlets with olive oil or avocado oil spray to help them crisp up. Air fry the chicken cutlets for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden brown and cooked through.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Check the internal temperature, which should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit for safety. Cook time will vary depending on the size of your chicken breast.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Remove the chicken cutlets from the air fryer and let them rest for a couple of minutes before serving. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley and serve. 
                </li>
