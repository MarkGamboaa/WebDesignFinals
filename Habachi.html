		<h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <h3>Marinate the Chicken</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    Add the coconut aminos, sesame oil, garlic, hoisin sauce, ginger, salt and pepper to a sealable bowl or bag for marinating. Mix together to evenly combine. Add the chopped chicken breast to the bowl and mix to coat. 
                </li>
				<li>
                    Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour but best overnight. Every so often give the bowl a shake to evenly marinate the chicken. 
                </li>
			</ol>

        <h3>For the Veggies</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    Heat ½ Tbsp. of olive oil in a large wok or large skillet. Add the zucchini, mushrooms and carrots to the wok and top with coconut aminos, salt and pepper. Saute over medium heat for 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are fork tender. 
                </li>
				<li>
                    Remove the sautéed vegetables from the pan and set aside. 
                </li>
			</ol>

        <h3>Cook the Chicken</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    Add ½ Tbsp. olive oil to the same pan you cooked the vegetables in and add the marinated chicken and any remaining sauce. 
                </li>
				<li>
                    Saute for 7-10 minutes until the chicken is browned and coked through and no longer pink. The internal temperature should read 165 degrees Fahrenheight with a meat thermometer
                </li>
			</ol>

        <h3>For the Rice</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    While the veggies and chicken cook add the uncooked rice to a large microwave safe bowl. Add 2 cups of water and microwave for 8 minutes (or according to the package instructions).
                </li>
				<li>
                    Remove the rice from the microwave and cook the riced cauliflower according to the package instructions.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Once the chicken is done cooking, remove, set aside and add the rice to the same pan along with the cooked cauliflower rice. Mix to evenly combine and push to the outer edges to create a hole in the center to cook your eggs.
                </li>
				<li>
                    Spray the center with nonstick spray and add 2 lightly scrambled eggs to the center of the pan to cook. Scramble in the center and once cooked through mix into the rice. Add the coconut aminos, dijon mustard, green onions, salt and pepper and mix to evenly combine. 
                </li>
			</ol>

        <h3>Assemble Your Bowls</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
                    Each bowl gets approximately 135 grams of rice (1 cup loosely packed), 100 grams of vegetables (1/2 cup) and 130 grams of chicken (3/4 cup). 
                </li>
				<li>
                    Top with toasted sesame seeds, red pepper flakes, sriracha sauce or chopped green onions for serving.
                </li>
